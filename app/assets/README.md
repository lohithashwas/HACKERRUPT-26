# Ringtone Asset

This directory should contain a ringtone file named `ringtone.mp3` for the fake call feature.

## How to add a ringtone:

1. Find a realistic phone ringtone (MP3 format)
2. Name it `ringtone.mp3`
3. Place it in this `assets/` directory
4. The app will automatically use it for fake calls

## Recommended sources:

- Use your phone's default ringtone
- Download from free sound libraries (ensure license allows use)
- Record a custom ringtone

## Note:

If no ringtone file is found, the app will continue to work but may not play audio during the fake call. The vibration and visual UI will still function normally.
